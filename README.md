- **Update** - when editing the information of the card
- **Delete** - when removing the card entirely

## Commits
**02/10/2021 - Initial Commit**
At the first day of development, I created most of the GUI in material design. I used FontAwesome and FlatIcon to up the looks and design.

The app's functionality is not yet accomplished. But I will continue to develop the app.

I started learning `Figma` for design mockups! See [mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/QM0sQxWJoXgchjIWP25ANi/Library-App?node-id=0%3A1).
